      <description>When the teaching in our course finishes you are to hand in a project. The formal requirements are found here along with details on grading. The exam period runs from August 23, 2019 from 15 PM to August 30 at 15 PM.
In this blog post we want to expand a little bit on how a good project will look. The focus of the project is to pose and interesting question to data that can be collected publicly and attempt to answer it.</description>

      <description>Guide to preparations It is necessary that you time preparing for the course. We expect that you have spent 30-50 hours on learning basic Python before we begin teaching. In particular you should do the following (prioritized order):
 Install anaconda and other software Install nbgrader with anaconda (write pip install nbgrader in the terminal/prompt) Open Assignment 0 in Jupyter notebook, see this guide on how to open and use a notebook Work on Assignment 0 - try to solve as much as possible When you get stuck then follow the trouble shooting guidline below - start with a) and move to d) see material below for learning Python - make sure you have read all material about the relevant problem search on Google, in particular stackexchange is very useful ask other people, you may already now other Python experts open a GitHub issue in our SDS2019 repository  If you have extra time you can familiarize yourself with your operating system (OS), i.</description>

      <description>This class will involve a lot of coding, for which you will need some basic tools. Please make sure to set up the following tools before the first day of class.
 Python and Jupyter notebook A git client A github account A text editor  We will discuss these tools in much more detail in class, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry if this is all new and perhaps a bit frightening right now.</description>
