## Other data types

In our follow up course, [Topics in Social Data Science](https://github.com/abjer/tsds/wiki), we teach advanced tools for text data and new data types. The new data types include spatial data and network data. If you are interesting in working with

- For spatial data we recommend [GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) which provides an overlay of Pandas for spatial visualizations and analysis - see tutorials for [making visualizations](https://geohackweek.github.io/vector/04-geopandas-intro/) or [computing features](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/Lesson2-geopandas-basics.html).

- For network data we recommend using [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) - a tutorial for NetworkX is found [here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/tutorial/index.html).

## Python vs R

Some students may have noticed that the course in 2015 and 2016 used R for data science, however, we have now opted for Python. Two of the main reasons are that Python has more simple syntax with more flexibility applications, making it easier to learn and better to structure data. In addition Python has a more extensive support for machine learning models, Big Data applications and making custom models, e.g. in microeconomics. See a thorough discussion of advantages between the two programs here:
