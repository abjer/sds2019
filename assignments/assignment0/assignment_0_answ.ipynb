For example when you go shopping you might want to buy koldskål, but only **if** the kammerjunker are on sale. **else** you will buy icecream. These kinds of logic come up everywhere in coding; self driving cars should go forward only **if** the light is green, items should be listed for sale in a web shop only **if** they are in stock, stars should be put on the estimates **if** they are significant etc. \n",
