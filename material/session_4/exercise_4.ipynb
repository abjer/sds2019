This Exercise part of exercises is the first part of three that work with weather data, the follow ups are Exercise Sections 6.1 and 7.1. Our source will be National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which have a global data collection going back a couple of centuries. This collection is called Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). A description of GHCN can be found [here](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/readme.txt)."
